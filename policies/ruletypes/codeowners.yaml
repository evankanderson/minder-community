description: Ensure that all mindersec repos have a CODEOWNERS file.
guidance: |
  The CODEOWNERS file defines what users are permitted to approve PRs in that
  repository.  We are using CODEOWNERS to limit code review to maintainers,
  so that non-maintainer members can manage issues and PRs.  See
  https://github.com/mindersec/community/issues/5 for background.

  This rule ensures that all repositories have a CODEOWNERS file.
